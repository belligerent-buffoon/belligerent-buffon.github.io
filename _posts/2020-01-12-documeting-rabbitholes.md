Over the years I have started demonstrating acute apathy for the world around me. My lack of opinions is rooted in the knowledge deficit that I have built by not keeping up with the world around. Writing is an excellent mechanism to defragment the thoughts and bring clarity into thoughts. Coupled with the intent to dig deeper, I hope it will make me well rounded in opinions as well as the reasoning supporting them. 

I have been guilty of picking sparse information and forge them into a _seemingly_ formidable opinion, despite knowing that half-backed knowledge is more dangerous than complete lack of knowledge. So this blog is an attempt to pen down dilemmas, questions, opinions and facts in the form of a question to see if it can help me improve overall awareness and rational thinking both. 

I hope I'll be able to fearlessly tread the tunnels where I have not ventured before. I hope to question every turn, dispell existing biases while acquiring new ones and build a blueprint of rabbit holes in my mind.
