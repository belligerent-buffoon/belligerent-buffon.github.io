Over the years I have started demonstrating acute apathy for the world around me. My lack of opinions is rooted in the knowledge deficit that I have built by not keeping up with the world around. Writing is an excellent mechanism to defragment the thoughts and bring clarity. Coupled with the intent to dig deeper, I hope it will make me well rounded in opinions as well as the reasoning supporting them. 

I have been guilty of picking sparse information and forge them into a _seemingly_ formidable opinions, despite knowing that half-backed knowledge is more dangerous than complete lack of it. So this blog is an attempt to pen down dilemmas, questions, opinions and facts in the form of a question to see if it can help me improve overall awareness and rational thinking both. 

I hope I'll be able to fearlessly tread the tunnels where I have not ventured before. I hope to question every turn, dispell existing biases while acquiring new ones and build a blueprint of rabbit holes in my mind. 

Thanks for reading!
